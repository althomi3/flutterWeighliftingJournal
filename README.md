# Flutter Weighlifting Journal
This is a mobile app developed with Flutter. The main use case is to add and view weightlifting sets to track progress.


# Implementation Decisions
## Navigation bar
The navigation bar was implemented with the NavigationBar class. Following best practices from the Flutter documentation on that class, the destinations were directly defined within the widget by using the NavigationDestination class. This is the recommended implementation for using the MUI3 navigation bar. This differs slightly from the Google Tutorial but seems to be the most updated way to implement the navigation bar.
